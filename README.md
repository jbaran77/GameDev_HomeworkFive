# Question 5 (a) <br> 

## Navigational Mesh
Defines walkable areas and obstacles in a 3D environment. Used to automatically take care of pathfinding, movement, and obstacle avoidance for game objects. With this, you can also edit the speed and acceleration an object moves with as well as stopping/ starting distance relative to another object.

# Question 2 <br>
## Particle System <br>
Used to simulate animations or visual effects such as smoke, fire, explosions, etc. It makes the game look and feel more realistic. A possible example could be adding smoke and fire to a campfire game object. 

# Question 4 <br>
## Animation Controller, Animation, Transition <br>
An animation controller refers to the state machine that contains certain animations and transitions between animations. These transitions can be based simply on time, or by custom triggers and conditions. For example, in our zombie project, the animation controller transitions from the move animation to the attack animation when the attack boolean variable is set to true (from script). An animation is a scripted motion or movement that a gameobject can perform.
